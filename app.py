    st.write('First I am going to import all the required libraries. The libraries used in this project are pandas, streamlit and resumescoringsystem. The resumescoringsystem is a custom library that I have created to rate the resumes based on the job description. The pandas library is used to create the dataframe and streamlit is used to create the webapp.')

    st.header('2. Loading the files')
    st.write('The load_file function is used to load the resume files and the load_job_description function is used to load the job description file. The load_file function reads the binary data from the database and converts it into a file-like object. The file-like object is then used to read the PDF file and extract the text content. The load_job_description function does the same thing but for the job description file.')

    st.header('3. Rating the resumes')
    st.write('The rate_resume function is used to rate the resumes based on the job description. The function takes the text content of the resume and the job description as input and returns the response. The response is a dictionary that contains the keywords from the job description and the count of those keywords in the resume.')

    st.header('4. Extracting notes for each resumes')
    st.write('The extract_note function is used to extract the notes for each resume. The function takes the response as input and returns the notes. The notes are extracted based on the keywords from the job description and the count of those keywords in the resume.')

    st.write('The find_score function is used to find the score for each resume. The function takes the response as input and returns the score. The score is calculated based on the count of the keywords from the job description in the resume.')

    st.header('6. Finalizing the result')
    st.write('The save_result function is used to save the result in a CSV file. The function takes the dataframe as input and saves it in a CSV file. The dataframe contains the resume name, score, note and response for each resume. The dataframe is then sorted based on the score in descending order.')

    st.header('7. Creating the dataframe')
    st.write('The process function is used to create the dataframe. The function takes the resume files and the job description file as input and returns the notes for each resume. The function first loads the files and the job description. It then rates the resumes, extracts the notes and gets the scores. Finally, it creates the dataframe and sorts it based on the score in descending order.')

    st.header('8. Setting the page configuration')
    st.write('The set_page_config function is used to set the page configuration. The function takes the page title, page icon, layout and initial sidebar state as input. The page title is set to "Resume Scoring System", the page icon is set to "human-resources.png", the layout is set to "centered" and the initial sidebar state is set to "auto".')

    st.header('9. Displaying the result')
    st.write('The title, caption and dataframe are displayed on the webapp. The title is set to "Resume Scoring System" and the caption is set to "This webapp is used to rate the resumes based on the job description". The dataframe contains the resume name and the score for each resume. The dataframe is then displayed on the webapp.')

    st.header('10. Conclusion')
    st.write('In this project, I have created a webapp that rates the resumes based on the job description. The webapp uses the resumescoringsystem library to rate the resumes. The library contains functions to load the files, rate the resumes, extract the notes, get the scores and save the result. The webapp also uses the pandas library to create the dataframe and the streamlit library to create the webapp. The webapp displays the title, caption and the dataframe on the webapp. The title is set to "Resume Scoring System" and the caption is set to "This webapp is used to rate the resumes based on the job description". The dataframe contains the resume name and the score for each resume. The dataframe is then displayed on the webapp.')
